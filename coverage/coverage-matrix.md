## Cross-cutting findings (running list)

- **Risk (A3/B3)** is the central limitation — SymboleoAC has no risk primitive.
  Modelled structurally (delivery triggers payment; payment survives). Candidate
  language extension for the Discussion section.
- **Cost (A9/B9)** — the 13-stage cost split is data, not semantics; SymboleoAC
  can attach payment obligations per stage but has no aggregation.
- **AC policy** — no direct Incoterms counterpart, but a genuine strength worth a
  subsection (who may read/write which resource, e.g. the bill of lading).
- **FOB vs FAS** (first differential) — identical coverage *pattern*, but the
  modelling device differs, faithfully (approach A): FOB delivers **on board**
  with a carrier-issued **bill of lading** in the seller's A6 document norm; FAS
  delivers **alongside** and the seller owes only the **usual proof of delivery
  alongside** (no `Carrier`/`BillOfLading` in the spec). So the A6 "Device"
  column above is the *FOB* device; FAS's A6 ✅ is via the `DocumentsProvided`
  proof-of-delivery event. The delivery-point difference (on board vs alongside)
  is the kind of inter-rule invariant the differential tests will assert.
- **F-terms vs C-terms** (CFR/CIF) — the second, sharper differential. F-terms
  (FOB/FAS) put carriage on the **buyer** (`oNominateVessel` + the
  suspend/resume-on-late-nomination powers), so **A4 = —, B4 = ✅**. C-terms
  (CFR/CIF) put carriage on the **seller** (`oContractCarriage`, replacing the
  nomination machinery with a `pTerminateNoCarriage` power), so the flip is
  **A4 = ✅, B4 = —**. Crucially, C-terms are where the **risk point and cost
  point diverge**: risk still passes **on board at shipment** (same `oDeliver` as
  FOB), while the seller's cost boundary runs to the **destination** port — a
  divergence SymboleoAC captures only *structurally* (delivery-on-board triggers
  the surviving payment; freight-to-destination is carried as data), never as a
  cost/risk semantics. This is the headline example for the paper's A3/A9 gaps.
- **Insurance (A5, CIF)** — `oInsure` makes the seller's insurance *obligation*
  first-class (✅ for presence), and `pTerminateNoInsurance` gives it a remedy,
  but the **cover level** (ICC (C), 110%) is only an `InsuranceObtained.coverLevel`
  data attribute — hence **◐**, not ✅: the level is recorded, not enforced as
  semantics.
- **Sea vs any-mode** (FCA/CPT/CIP mirror FAS/CFR/CIF) — the family axis is
  *orthogonal* to the F/C axis, so coverage patterns repeat across it: FCA has
  the same column as the F-terms FAS/FOB, CPT the same as CFR, CIP the same as
  CIF. Only the **vocabulary/device** changes — sea rules name a `vessel` /
  `port` / on-board-or-alongside delivery and a **bill of lading**; any-mode
  rules name a `carrier` / `place` / handover-to-the-(first-)carrier delivery
  and a generic **transport document** (a proof-of-delivery `DocumentsProvided`
  event, no `BillOfLading`). CIP raises insurance to **ICC (A)** vs CIF's ICC (C)
  — a data-only difference (`insuranceCover`). This orthogonality is itself a
  finding: SymboleoAC expresses the normative structure identically regardless of
  transport mode; the mode shows up only as naming, never as different norms.
